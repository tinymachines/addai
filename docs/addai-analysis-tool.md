Let me first check your project knowledge to understand the end-goal context, then I'll create the analytical tool.Perfect! Now I understand the full context. You're building a real-time EEG attention detection system for ADD management, and you need to analyze the data quality before training your ML model. Based on your project knowledge, I can see you're aiming for sliding window tokenization and temporal embedding approaches.

Let me create a comprehensive analytical tool that will help you assess the statistical properties and ML-readiness of your EEG data:This analytical tool is specifically designed for your attention detection project and addresses all your key requirements:

## Key Features:

**üîç Data Quality Assessment:**
- Loads and parses your JSON files (xaa.json - xae.json)
- Analyzes signal quality metrics and temporal sampling consistency
- Identifies missing data and outliers

**üìä Statistical Analysis:**
- Comprehensive descriptive statistics for all EEG power bands
- Time-domain characteristics analysis
- Variance stability across time windows

**üéØ ML Readiness Testing:**
- **Randomness Analysis**: Uses autocorrelation and runs tests to ensure your data isn't random noise
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies temporal structure that ML models can learn from
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines relationships between power bands for feature engineering

**üîß Preprocessing Insights:**
- Tests multiple normalization strategies (Standard, MinMax, Robust scaling)
- Analyzes the impact of different normalization approaches on your data distribution

**‚è±Ô∏è Sliding Window Analysis:**
- Tests different window sizes (10, 30, 60 samples) for tokenization
- Analyzes window-to-window transitions to optimize your embedding strategy
- Calculates stability metrics for temporal feature extraction

**üß† Attention-Specific Biomarkers:**
- Theta/Beta ratio analysis (key ADHD/attention marker)
- Alpha suppression patterns (external attention indicator)
- Multi-band correlation patterns for cognitive load assessment

## To use the tool:

1. Place your JSON files (xaa.json - xae.json) in the same directory
2. Run the script - it will automatically generate:
   - Comprehensive statistical report
   - ML readiness score (0-100)
   - Visualization plots saved as 'eeg_analysis_plots.png'
   - Specific recommendations for preprocessing and feature extraction

The tool will help you determine:
- If your data has sufficient temporal structure for ML training
- Optimal sliding window sizes for your tokenization approach
- Best normalization strategy for your neural network
- Which EEG bands show the strongest attention-related patterns

This analysis will be crucial for your next steps in encoding and tokenizing the data stream for your TinyGrad-based attention detection model!
